If, like me, you are worried that Google's Blogger will follow Google Plus to the Great BitBucket in the Sky, it is possible to migrate your Blogger posts to a personal blog hosted on GitHub Pages.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
